### About the Project

Welcome to our exciting project, an interactive exploration of fundamental data structures! Here, we invite you to dive into the fascinating world of binary search trees, min heaps, and minimum spanning trees. Our project is designed to provide you with a hands-on experience, allowing you to not only understand the structure and operations of these common data structures but also witness them in action.

### Why This Project?

Understanding data structures is a crucial aspect of computer science and software development. They form the backbone of many algorithms and applications, and a solid grasp of how they work is essential for building efficient and elegant software solutions. However, learning about these structures can often be daunting and abstract. That's where our project comes in!

### Interactive Learning

Our project isn't your typical dry academic exercise. We believe that learning should be engaging, interactive, and, most importantly, fun! With our project, you can interact with these data structures in real-time and see how common operations unfold step by step. It's like having a personal tour guide through the intricate world of binary search trees, min heaps, and minimum spanning trees.

### Key Features

- [x] Binary Search Tree: Explore the magic of binary search trees, where nodes are organised in a hierarchical structure. Witness the elegance of insertion, deletion, and traversal operations as they unfold before your eyes.

- [x] Min Heap: Dive into the world of min heaps, a specialised tree-based structure with a unique ordering property. Observe how elements are organised, extracted, and inserted, all while maintaining the heap's integrity.

- [x] Minimum Spanning Tree: Discover the concept of minimum spanning trees and their applications in various domains. Follow along as we construct spanning trees using Kruskal's algorithm, unlocking the secrets of efficient network design.

### Learn, Explore, Enjoy

Our project is more than just a learning resource; it's an opportunity to explore, experiment, and enjoy the journey of discovering data structures. Whether you're a student looking to solidify your understanding, a developer seeking practical insights, or simply a curious individual interested in the inner workings of algorithms, this project is for you.  
Join us on this captivating adventure through data structures, where every click and interaction brings you one step closer to mastering these foundational building blocks of computer science and programming.
